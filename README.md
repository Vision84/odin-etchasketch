# odin-etchasketch

This is my Etch-A-Sketch project for The Odin Project. By hovering over each pixel, you can turn it to black essentially creating a drawing board on the web. I did my best to reduce the size of my JavaScript and HTML. I could probably reduce the JavaScript even more if I was not dynamically creating every single element (other than the button) in my HTML.

## REFLECTION

When I started, I had absolutely no idea of what I was doing. I was first attempting to use Flexboxes to create my grid, but realized that wasn't the easiest way for me to understand how to do it. I researched a little about CSS Grids and figured out that I could implement this really fast. This let me finish the project in about an hour
